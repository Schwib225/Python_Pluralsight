  No obvious bugs vs No obvious bugs    # KISS principle is key here

Linux Scripting and Administration

# for this example we have a json file called input.json and it has the following code

  {
        "name": "Jason"
        "hobbies": ["music", "programming", "games"],
        "job": "Software Developer"
  }
  
    vi input.py
        import json                                                         # this will allow us to work with the data

        with open('input.json', 'r') as input:                              # this will open the file input.json above as read only to pull data
                obj = json.load(input)
                with open('output.txt', 'w') as output:                     # this will open a new file called output.txt and the following code will write the hobby list to it
                        output.write(obj['name'] + "'s Hobbies:\n")
                        for hobby in obj['hobbies']:
                                output.write(hobby+ "\n")
                            
 # now lets look at manipulating processes
 
    vi 
        import subprocess
        pl = subprocess.Popen(['ps', '-U', '0'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]           # This will write the output of ps -U to the variable 'pl' then we print it with the next line
        print(pl.decode('utf-8'))
        
        
Web Development Example 

    Examples of different types of web development:
        APIs - Flask, Bottle, Pyramid
        Websites - Django, TurboGears, web2py
        Apps - Plone, django-cms, mezzanine

    vi service.py                                                               # define flask service
        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        @app.route("/")
        def hello():
                return "Hello World!"
        
        @app.route("/usr/<username>")
        def show_user(username):
            return "User: %s" % username
        
    FLASK_APP=service.py flask run                                              # Run the application
    curl localhost:5000                                                         # you should see 'hello world' at this point
    curl localhost:5000/user/jolson                                             # this will print "User: jolson" and may require some setup on the actual host - the demo didnt specify
    
    django-admin startproject mysite
    cd mysite
    tree .                                                                      # note the different files here
    python3 manage.py runserver
    
    go to localhost:8000 
    
Application Scripting

    # We will use blender in this demo - (blender 3d)
    1. Change the bottom view to the python console view - full on repel
    2. bpy.data.objects - this will show all objects (number of objects)
    3. list(bpy.data.objects) - this will make them into a list
    4. cube = bpy.data.objects["Cube"]
        cube.location                                                             # drag the cube after this command to see the changes - run the command again
    
    import mathutils
    cube.location += mathutils.Vector((1, 1, 1))                                  # this will move the cube

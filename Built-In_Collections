    Reversing and sorting into copies
        - reversed() and sorted() are the out of place equivalents to list.reverse() and list.sort()
        - They return a reverse iterator and a new list respectively

        y = sorted(x)
        y
        x

        q = reversed(p)
        q                                   # note this will return a list_reverseiterator object which must be converted to a list
        list(q)                             # done!

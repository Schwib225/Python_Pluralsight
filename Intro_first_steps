The Basics
    
    python.org - lots of info here, documentation, community, etc.
    
    choco install python --- for windows
    brew install python3 --- for mac
    
    Working with python
        
        1. python executable
            used for executing python file or rudimentary REPL
        2. pip (pip installs packages)

Learning and Documentation

    python.org/about/gettingstarted
    docs.python.org                                                     # has tutorials and lots of other information - installing and distributing modules, etc
        includes release notes, which contains all PEPs - any enhancement for python that was proposed 

Working with the Code of Others

    pypi index - this is where people publish their python code to - can use pip to install this code
    
    pip - installs, uninstalls packages, also manages dependencies and package groups (so we dont need to worry about individual packages) as well as version control
    
    How to use pip:
    
    pip install <package name>                                          # very simplistic

Opening Files

  open()
    # Takes many arguements but the most common are:
        File: the path to the file (required)
        Mode: Read, write, or append plus binary or text
        encoding: encoding to use in text mode
        
    Files are stored as binary
    Binary mode reflects the raw data in the file
    Text Mode encodes and decodes the binary contents with the default (or another if you specify) encoding 
        by default, universal newlines are used
        the default encoding is utf-8
        
    write()         # this is encode
    read()          # this is decode
    
    import sys
    sys.getdefaultencoding()                    # this isn't always the same on different systems, make sure you're confirming the encoding is what you think it is
    
    # Documentation for encoding support: docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings

Writing Text

  python 
  f = open('wasteland.txt', mode='wt', encoding='utf-8')        # w is for write and t is for text 
  
      # Note that there are 3 modes, read (r), write (w), and append(a)
      # for each of these there are selectors, binary(b) or text(t)
      
  open() returns a file like object
  help() works on modules, methods and types
  and it works on instances too! - remember, everything is an object!
  
  help(f)                                                       # note that we can write to the file
  
  f.write('What are the roots that clutch, ')
  f.write('what branches grow\n')
  f.write('Out of this stony rubbish? ')
  f.close()                                                     # At this point the file is closed and the contents are available to the rest of the system, you can verify by accessing this new file you created, its in the working dir
  

Reading Text

  g = open('wasteland.txt', mode='rt', encoding='utf-8')
  g.read(32)                                                    # reads the number of characters, not bytes
  g.read()                                                      # reads the entire file contents
  g.read()                                                      # since it has been fully read it returns nothing
  g.seek(0)                                                     # now the read can start over
  
  # there are easier ways to read files than using read
  g.readline()                                                  # read the first line
  g.readline()                                                  # read the second line
  g.readline()                                                  # this returns an empty string
  g.seek(0)                                                     # return to the beginnning of the line
  g.readlines()                                                 # reads all lines in a file, ensure you have enough memory for this
  g.close()                                                     # close the file once done with it
  
Appending Text

  h = open('wasteland.txt', mode='at', encoding='utf-8')      # 'a' for append
  
  h.writelines(                                               # there is no 'write' supported but there is 'writelines'
      ['Son of man, \n',
        'You cannot say, or guess, ',
        'for you know only, \n',
        'A heap of broken images, ',
        'where the sun beats \n'])
  h.close()

Iterating over Files

    # create files.py in editor
    
    import sys
    
    f = open(sys.argv[1], mode='rt', encoding='utf-8')
    for line in f:
        print(line)
    f.close()
    
    # In repl
    
    python files.py wasteland.txt
    
    # note the extra line added because of the print function, to get rid of this, modify the code to use sys.stdout.write(line)
    
    f = open(sys.argv[1], mode='rt', encoding='utf-8')
    for line in f:
        sys.stdout.write(line)
    f.close()

    # Again, test in the repl
    
    python files.py wasteland.txt

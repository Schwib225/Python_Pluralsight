Opening Files

  open()
    # Takes many arguements but the most common are:
        File: the path to the file (required)
        Mode: Read, write, or append plus binary or text
        encoding: encoding to use in text mode
        
    Files are stored as binary
    Binary mode reflects the raw data in the file
    Text Mode encodes and decodes the binary contents with the default (or another if you specify) encoding 
        by default, universal newlines are used
        the default encoding is utf-8
        
    write()         # this is encode
    read()          # this is decode
    
    import sys
    sys.getdefaultencoding()                    # this isn't always the same on different systems, make sure you're confirming the encoding is what you think it is
    
    # Documentation for encoding support: docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
